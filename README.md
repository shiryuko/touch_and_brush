# Touch & Brush

![Touch and Brush Game](/website/t&b_web.gif)

Touch & Brush is a **mental agility homebrew game for the Nintendo DS** that I developed in C++ using [Devkitpro's](https://devkitpro.org/) toolkit as part of my **final degree project** in Multimedia Engineering.
The game challenges players to draw specific patterns on the touchscreen to defeat enemies. Each level introduces various enemy types, each with unique attributes and patterns, which must be overcome before they defeat the player.

In this project, not only I learned about the difficulties and details of making a game for this handheld system, I also made my own **pattern recognition algorythm**. To read about more technical information about the development of this project, download the project's report at [RUA](https://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/109319?mode=full).
